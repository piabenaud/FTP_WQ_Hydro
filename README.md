Flat Tor Pan: Flow, Water Quality and Ecohydrological Change

This project contains the data preparation and analysis for the flow and water quality data, as conducted for:

Gatis, N., Benaud, P., Anderson, A., Ashe, J., Grand-Clement, E., Luscombe, D.J., Puttock, A. and Brazier, R.E.  (2023) Peatland restoration increases water storage and attenuates downstream stormflow but does not guarantee an immediate reversal of long-term ecohydrological degradation. Nature Scientific Reports.

00_Event_Extraction - This folder needs to be ran on the flow data before subsequent analysis. Josie Ashe event separation tool, PhD thesis in preparation, University of Exeter.

The rest is set up to run through the use of {targets} using the run.R script.
